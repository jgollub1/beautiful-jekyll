<!-- subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me -->

I was born and raised in Santa Rosa, CA. Since starting college, I've lived in Boston, Buenos Aires, Kyoto, New York, Philadelphia, and Tokyo.

My two favorite things to play are guitar ðŸŽ¸ and tennis ðŸŽ¾. In July '18, I'll be starting my first full-time job as a software engineer at Blend Labs in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from Harvard University in December '17 with a concentration in Statistics and Computer Science and a secondary in Music. Without a doubt, my favorite teacher during my studies was the omnipotent [Vijay Iyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Iyer).
