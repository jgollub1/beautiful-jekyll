My two favorite things to play are guitar ðŸŽ¸ and tennis ðŸŽ¾. In July '18, I'll be starting my first full-time job as a software engineer at Blend Labs in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from Harvard University in December '17 with a concentration in Statistics and Computer Science and a secondary in Music. Without a doubt, my favorite teacher during my studies was the omnipotent [Vijay Iyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Iyer). 

Contact me at [jglub@sonic.net](jglub@sonic.net) or feel free to explore my fairly wide-ranging interests.



What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.  ðŸŽ¸
