A recap of the past year.

**Top 2 Achievements:**

1) Traveled solo through Asia - Hit eight countries over the course of two and a half months (Thailand, China, Vietname, Singapore, Cambodia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea).<br>
2) Moved to SF Mission - While I bike to work at a tech company every day, at least I'm not so much of the gentrification problem as to buy organic vegetable juice every day.

**Top 2 Books (Lifestyle):**

1) Why We Sleep (Matt Walker) - Brings light to one of the most pressing public health issues today and will convince you to prioritize sleep above all else.<br>
2) Deep Work (Cal Newport) - I think, by default, we come nowhere near reaching our full potential. The insights in this book offer concrete, actionable ways to make significant progress towards that ideal.

**Top 2 Books (Entertainment):**

1) Bullshit Jobs - 10 minutes into reading this at City Lights Bookstore, I was sold. Speaks to deep-rooted social issues many of us take for granted.<br>
2) Elon Musk - Time after time, Elon carries out his vision with incredible conviction, trash-talking both employees and competitors along the way. He's got an incredible story as well.

**Top 2 Podcasts:**

1) How I Built This - Interviews founders of Airbnb, Lyft, Linkedin, Stitch Fix, Slack, WeWork, Dell, etc.<br>
2) Software Engineering Daily - Not as accessible, but a wide degree of interesting topics covered for anyone interested in tech/software.

**Top 2 Games:**

1) One Night Werewolf - Recently introduced this to several of my friends, who ended up loving it as much as I do. Reminds me of when I played with friends until 7am during Senior Week.<br>
2) Poker (hold 'em) - Brings me back to my trading firm days...

**Top 2 Albums:**

1) Skyriser (Maxo) - Recent album by an electronic artist I discovered on Soundcloud. His harmonic palette is just perfect.<br>
2) Ask For Chaos (Gilad Hekselman) - Didn't check out that many new albums this year, but this one stood out

**Top 2 TV Shows:**

1) Silicon Valley - Caught up with all five seasons this year. Huge fan. Also fairly realistic.<br>
2) Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - A bunch of friends who like anime kept recommending this so I finally watched it.

**Top 2 New Countries Visited:**

1) Taiwan - "Taiwan number one" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN0vUlljX0I<br>
2) Cambodia - The food was amazing and you can take touristy photos at all the temples with a "Tomb Raider" backdrop.

**Top 2 Hostels:**

1) Meander Taipei (Taiwan) - Met the coolest people here. All the nearby restaurants they recommend are 10/10 as well.<br>
2) Time Travelers Relax (Seoul) - Staff was incredible here (make sure to chill with DJ and Rob). Per their recommendation, hiked up a mountain (Bukhansan) with fellow travelers at the hostel.

**Top 2 Live Music Performances:**

1) Chick Corea Trio (SF Jazz) - I'm so glad I got to see Chick perform live. At 77 years old, he played with absolute depth and nuance, as if spinning the most intricate web in real time.<br>
2) Morgan Guerin Group (Jazz Gallery) - Caught this concert when I was visiting friends in New York in March. Brought a bunch of college friends to a packed house, only having previously listened to an album of Morgan's that I stumbled upon online a year ago. I'm very excited to see where Morgan's musical vision takes him in the coming years.

**Top 2 go-to Foods:**

1) Trader Joe's Japanese Fried Rice (Vegetarian) - At $3/pack, it's embarrassing how much I eat these...<br>
2) Hummus

**Top 2 Side Projects:**

1) Built a <a href="https://github.com/jgollub1/guitar_dp">web app</a> that plays midi files on guitar. I will demo it soon.<br>
2) <a href="http://gollub.me">This website</a>

**Top 2 new programming languages/technologies:**

1) Typescript - It's like javascript but less awful because it enforces types.<br>
2) Serverless - For some reason the idea of telling AWS to run arbitrary code from some server farm in the desolate reaches of the Pacific Northwest sounds endlessly amusing to me.
