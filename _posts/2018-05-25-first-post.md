I'm currently writing from Krabi Ao Nang, Thailand with a 10-bed hostel dorm all to myself. What more could you ask for? I've been meaning to set up this website for some time to organize recent thoughts and ideas.

These past five months, I've enjoyed a second "gap" semester. After taking a semester off from college in spring '16 to work/chill in New York, I finally graduated college in December '17. Keeping calm under every Ivy League student's nightmare of graduating unemployed, I was fortunate enough to finish my job search by early February, when I decided to join Blend Labs as a software engineer. Thinking longingly back to my previous semester off, I couldn't help but request to start in the summer, allotting myself another five months to do as I please.

Shortly after, I flew back to Boston for several weeks to work with Zoba at the Harvard i-lab and ship my belongings back home (which I had left under my roommates' beds). Zoba is an early-stage startup working on crime prediction with crowd-sourced geospatial data and working with the team was pretty fun. Any time you join a company with only a handful of people, you get to have massive influence over everything you work on and I would be surprised if I don't seek such an opportunity sometime down the road. After catching up with friends in Boston, I visited a handful of friends across the country. All in all, I saw friends and family in Manhattan, Dunkirk NY, Salt Lake City UT, Boulder CO and Seattle WA. Many thanks to everyone who hosted me. A week after passover sedar in Seattle with relatives, I set off to Asia.

At this point, I have been traveling solo in Asia for a month and a half. My travels have taken me to Thailand, China, Vietnam and Singapore. Despite having my phone stolen at Thailand's New Year's water celebration (Songkran) in Bangkok and getting sick for a week in Vietnam, it's been a great experience. I'm currently back in Thailand for a second time and will be continuing with Cambodia, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea over the next four weeks. While I held apprehensions about traveling alone, my experience has been smoother than expected. Hopping from hostel to hostel, you always have the option to meet a variety of people. While I don't click with everybody I meet, I've met a ton of cool people. Traveling alone, I can easily alternate between hanging out with new friends and setting aside time for myself.

Some of that newfound time has been set aside for books, as I've rediscovered a passion for reading for the first time in many years. Since graduating college, I've read

-Fermat’s Enigma

-A Feast for Crows

-The Birth of Korean Cool

-The Violinist’s Thumb

-The Jazz of Physics

-Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

-Ready Player One

-A Brief History of Time

-The Name of Wind

-The Fellowship of the Ring

-The Mystery of the Yellow Room

If it's not clear, I'm a sucker for fantasy. Of those, "The Name of Wind" stood out because it features a protagonist who is a performer at heart. Having grown up as an actor in a traveling troupe, Kvothe uses his silver tongue to slip out of unsavory circumstances and plays the lute well enough to bring his audience to tears. And more recently, I've become interested in physics. Stephon Alexander's journey towards becoming a physics professor while repeatedly turning back to music as his compass in "The Jazz of Physics" reminded me of multiple classmates from college. While it's crazy how little I read during college, it's only testament to how busy my schedule was. Or how busy I perceived it to be. Looking back, I know that much of my free time during those years was directed towards practicing and writing music.

Recently, I've also been trying to make web apps out of a couple personal projects. One to help you learn melodies more efficiently on guitar and another to integrate research from my senior thesis and provide live tennis match forecasts. Maybe mentioning this will motivate me to finish them sometime soon. In the meantime, I'll catch a little more Thailand sun.






<!-- I mean, hey, I just completed a degree in computer science four years after receiving an atrocious grade in "intro to computer science." Anyway, I know these two projects must sound really exciting to most people and you'll be able to check them out on this site once they're ready. -->

<!-- A lot of people I know may have had apprehensions about taking a long break before work. Many peopl     don't know how to not work hard -->
