My former teachers include Randy Vincent, Vijay Iyer, Mike Moreno, Jonathan Kreisberg and Chris Pimentel. I took Professor Iyer's seminar in creative music my freshmen year and played in a piano-guitar duo that met with him weekly my junior year. Whenever we studied with him he would always make us compose, which was valuable beyond words.

I played guitar in Harvard's Monday Jazz Band for two years under Don Braden and one semester under Yosvany Terry. Through the band's 'Performing with Artists' program, we were able to perform alongside Eddie Henderson, Lionel Loueke, Teri Lynne Carrington, John Locke, Wallace Roney, George Coleman, Harold Mabern, Vijay Iyer, Ralph Peterson and George Cables.

In 2015, I taught a seminar on Jazz Music and History to fifty of China's top high school students at Harvard's HSYLC conference in Shanghai. In retrospect, having the chance to talk for hours on end about this art form and share my passion with students with no background was one of my most gratifying musical experiences.

In 2016, I was fortunate to receive Harvard's Artist Development Fellowship to attend the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music. You can listen to several recordings of my original compositions from the workshop below.
