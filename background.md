My former teachers include Randy Vincent, Vijay Iyer, Mike Moreno, and Chris Pimentel. With Professor Iyer, I took his seminar in creative music my freshmen year and played in a piano-guitar duo that met him weekly during my junior year. Studying with him, he would always make us compose, which was valuable beyond words.

I played guitar in Harvard's Monday Jazz Band for two years under Don Braden and one semester under Yosvany Terry. Through the band's 'Performing with Artists' program, we were able to perform alongside Eddie Henderson, Lionel Loueke, Teri Lynne Carrington, John Locke, Wallace Roney, George Coleman, Harold Mabern, Vijay Iyer, Ralph Peterson and George Cables.

In 2016, I was very fortunate to receive Harvard's Artist Development Fellowship to attend the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music. You can listen to several recordings of my compositions from the workshop below.
